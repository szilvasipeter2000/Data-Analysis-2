# Data-Analysis-2
--- 
This research project aims to investigate the relationship between ownership demographics and loan-related variables in a geo-specific dataset. The research question involves creating a binary dummy variable, "white_owned," and exploring its association with loan metrics. Control variables such as gender, veteran status, and political affiliation of the state will be considered in the analysis. The project seeks to uncover insights into the factors influencing loan patterns and ownership demographics, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
